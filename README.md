Becuase who doesn't miss scramble porn?

# The hell is going on here?
*cough* Simple. We open some terminals to encode and playback a video to a named pipe, then we wait a couple of seconds and encode another video to the same pipe. Somtimes it can look danker when you do this manually, opening multiple terminals and starting the FFmpeg processes *first*, then the FFplay process last so that it all initiates at once (▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)
